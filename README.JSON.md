# INTRODUCTION

This stash contains JSON documents.

Each %.array.json file contains an array of JSON documents.

They can --and are partly meant to --be loaded into a database.

You could load all my JSON files about farming, botany and biology into one database or one MongoDB collection,
or only those closely related to farming (crops, herbs).

You could load all my JSON files into one single database.


# Manipulating JSON through JavaScript

On the other hand, since JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation: why not handle them (arrays of JSON objects) through the JavaScript programming language? I am working on just that. Essentially, I produce an array A2 an array of objects A1 by chaining Array methods like this:
```
let A2 = A1.filter(PREDICATE).map(MAP_FUNCTION);
```
Filters and maps live in their same-named files: *filters.js* and *maps.js* respectively.

This line is tested and demonstrated through web page *js.assorted.html*, which processes the array defined in *assorted.array.js*.

(Files named like *FIELD.array.js* hold the declaration of an array of objects, such as `const assorted = [OBJ0, OBJ1...]` These files are generated by means of a `Makefile` rule.)

Now, in place of "assorted" you could substitute other names such as "computing", "antropologia" etc. so that, say *js.computing.html*, would be made to import and processes file *computing.array.js*


# Viewing and Consulting

You can view my %.json files in a text editor such as kate or notepad++.

Text editors usually have a syntax-highlighting feature,
which makes reading computer languages such as JSON much easier.

Additionally, you can consult and generally manipulate my %.json files through:
- `jq` (JSON query): a command line tool
- `couchdb`: a       JSON DataBase Management System (DBMS)
- `mongodb`: another JSON DataBase Management System (DBMS)
(All three are free of charge.)

(I use `jq` to check up on syntax. If I run `jq '.' FILE.array.json`, then any mistakes are pointed out plus the lines where they are found.)

# SPECIAL FILES

The latest JSON documents are defined in *assorted.array.json*.

It may hold non-compliant documents or half-finished ones.

JSON templates or schema are held in:
- *templates.json*
- *computing.templates.json*
- *botany.templates.json*
and so on


# ORDINARY FILES

These hold several JSON documents in an array each

# TODOs

[ ] check up on *farming.crops.json*
[ ] check up on *crops.former.json*

[ ] Is *agricultura.array.json* compliant?

[ ] complete *plant_families.array.json* with all major plant families

[ ] move crops pecan (`"name": "pecan"`) and peanut (`"name": "peanut"`) into *farming.array.json* into *crops.array.json*


# Deviant Formats

Some files hold JSON documents in "deviant" formats, that is they do not adhere to an agreed structure because they were written a long time ago.

Some of them are:
- crops.array.json
- herbs.array.json
