Some of the files hold JSON documents with a machine-generated id field:
- farming.crops.json
- crops.json

Some other files have no such machine-generated id field:
- plant_families.json
- herbs.json
- reutilizables.json
- additions.json

NOTE: bookmarks*.json looks like entirely machine-generated, almost binary.
