WARNING
-------
Files:
- templates.json
- biology.array.json
- health.array.json
- README.JSON.md
- assorted.array.json
- nutrition.array.json
were added to my pages, not to my databases, by mistake



Some of the files hold JSON documents with a machine-generated id field:
- farming.crops.json
- crops.json

Some other files have no such machine-generated id field:
- plant_families.json
- herbs.json
- reutilizables.json
- additions.json

NOTE: bookmarks*.json looks like entirely machine-generated, almost binary.
