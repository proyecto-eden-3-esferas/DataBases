Each tip contains a set of aggregated vesicles—cellular structures consisting of proteins, lipids, and other organic molecules—called the Spitzenkörper. Both fungi and oomycetes grow as filamentous hyphal cells. In contrast, similar-looking organisms, such as filamentous green algae, grow by repeated cell division within a chain of cells."

  "description": [
    "The thallus (or body) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as lamina (or blades) that originate from elongated stem-like structures, referred to as the stipes. A root-like structure (called the holdfast) anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean. Gas-filled bladders (pneumatocysts) form at the base of blades of American species, such as Nereocystis lueteana, to hold the kelp blades close to the surface to access light for photosynthesis. The stipes are generally covered with a slimy mucilage layer, rather than a waxy cuticle."
